I am currently a undergraduate student at the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Distributed Machine Learning**, with a particular focus on:
* **LLM-based Agents & Safety**: Developing rational agent frameworks for text anonymization, privacy preservation, and adversarial defense.
* **Robust Federated Learning**: Designing secure and fair decentralized training mechanisms.

I am always open to academic collaborations and discussions. Please feel free to reach out to me via email.

## 🔥 News
* **[Dec. 2025]** One paper titled *"Look Twice before You Leap: A Rational Agent Framework for Localized Adversarial Anonymization"* was released on arXiv.
* **[Nov. 2025]** One paper titled *"Exploiting Parasitic Dependency for Free-Rider Elimination in Blockchain-based Federated Learning"* was accepted by **IEEE IPCCC 2025**.
* **[Sep. 2023]** Started my journey as a student at UESTC.

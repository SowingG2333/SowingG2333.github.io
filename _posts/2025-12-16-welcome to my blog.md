Welcome! 👋

This is the very first post on my personal academic website. I built this site to document my journey as an undergraduate researcher at **UESTC**.

### 🚀 What to expect here?

I plan to use this space to share my thoughts and learnings on:

1.  **Paper Reading Notes**: Deep dives into the latest papers on **Robust Federated Learning** and **LLM Safety**.
2.  **Tech Tutorials**: Practical tips on **PyTorch**, **Linux/Docker**, and **LLM Agent** development.
3.  **Research Updates**: News about my latest publications, arXiv preprints, and project releases.

### 🌟 A bit about me

I am currently a Junior undergraduate student passionate about ensuring fairness in decentralized systems and building rational agents for LLMs. If you are interested in my work, feel free to check out my [Publications](/publications/) or [About Me](/) page.

Stay tuned for more updates!
